## Configuration Settings

* Each of these settings can be specified in `puppet.conf` or on the
  command line.
* When using boolean settings on the command line, use `--setting` and
  `--no-setting` instead of `--setting (true|false)`.
* Settings can be interpolated as `$variables` in other settings; `$environment`
  is special, in that puppet master will interpolate each agent node's
  environment instead of its own.
* Multiple values should be specified as comma-separated lists; multiple
  directories should be separated with the system path separator (usually
  a colon).
* Settings that take a single file or directory can optionally set the owner,
  group, and mode for their value: `rundir = $vardir/run { owner = puppet,
  group = puppet, mode = 644 }`
* The Puppet executables will ignore any setting that isn't relevant to
  their function.

See the [configuration guide][confguide] for more details.
