    @doc = "Executes external commands.  It is critical that all commands
      executed using this mechanism can be run multiple times without
      harm, i.e., they are *idempotent*.  One useful way to create idempotent
      commands is to use the checks like `creates` to avoid running the
      command unless some condition is met.

      Note that you can restrict an `exec` to only run when it receives
      events by using the `refreshonly` parameter; this is a useful way to
      have your configuration respond to events with arbitrary commands.

      Note also that if an `exec` receives an event from another resource,
      it will get executed again (or execute the command specified in `refresh`, if there is one).

      There is a strong tendency to use `exec` to do whatever work Puppet
      can't already do; while this is obviously acceptable (and unavoidable)
      in the short term, it is highly recommended to migrate work from `exec`
      to native Puppet types as quickly as possible.  If you find that
      you are doing a lot of work with `exec`, please at least notify
      us at Puppet Labs what you are doing, and hopefully we can work with
      you to get a native resource type for the work you are doing.

      **Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing an exec's cwd or the executable
      file used in an exec's command, the exec resource will autorequire those
      files. If Puppet is managing the user that an exec should run as, the
      exec resource will autorequire that user."

        This would run `logrotate` only if that test returned true.

        Note that this command follows the same rules as the main command,
        which is to say that it must be fully qualified if the path is not set.

        Also note that onlyif can take an array as its value, e.g.:
