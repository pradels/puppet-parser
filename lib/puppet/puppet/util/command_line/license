# = Synopsis
#
# Check and report the license status of Puppet Enterprise install
#
# = Usage
#
#   puppet license
#
# = Description
#
# Puppet Enterprise requires a license and support agreement for operation,
# and the +puppet license+ application checks and reports the status of that
# license for the operator.
#
# It reports your current node count compliance status, as well as checking
# the expiration status of your support agreement with Puppet Labs - or, for
# the complimentary ten node free license, confirms that you have no support
# agreement.
#
# = Usage Notes
#
# This must be run locally on the machine that is the Puppet Certificate
# Authority, in order to provide access to the certificate pool used to
# validate the installation and license count.
#
# The output of this command is not an API, and may change in future
# versions.  While we intend to provide a machine-focused API at some point,
# and do not expect gratuitous changes, please don't rely too heavily on
# parsing the output of this command.
#
# = Options
#
# None; puppet license runs without configuration.
#
# = Example
#
#    ] puppet license
#    You have 12 active and 3 inactive nodes in your CA
